# Finding_Donors_for_CharityML
An educational supervised learning project. The goal is to predict donors for a fictional non-profit organization. For this project, I:
1. Explored data
2. Transformed and scaled features
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Created a training and prediction pipeline
5. Evaluated and juxtaposed performance of four models:
    * Gaussian Naive Bayes
    * Gradient Boosted Regression
    * Support Vector Machine models
    * Logistic Regression
6. Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search
7. Examined feature importances

Model performance was measured using four metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.

### Some code was provided by Udacity for guidance
Template code is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.
