# Finding_Donors_for_CharityML
An educational supervised learning project. The goal is to predict donors for a fictional non-profit organization. For this project, I completed the following tasks:
1. Explored data
2. Transformed and scaled features
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Created a training and prediction pipeline
5. Evaluated and juxtaposed performance of four models:
    * Gaussian Naive Bayes
    * Gradient Boosted Regression
    * Support Vector Machine models
    * Logistic Regression
6. Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search
7. Examined feature importances

Model performance was measured using four metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.

### Required libraries                       
This project uses Python 3 with Numpy, Pandas, Pyplot, Scikit-Learn, and Jupyter.

### Files
The project code can be found in the Jupyter notebook "Finding_Donors_for_CharityML.ipynb". The raw data is in "census.csv", and was provided by Udacity. 

### Some code was provided by Udacity for guidance
Udacity provided the `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file, which were required to complete the work. Udacity reminds students that "...the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate." Udacity also provided some template code within the Jupyter notebook to guide students in the right direction.
